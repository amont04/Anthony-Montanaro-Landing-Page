            With the Internet spreading like wildfire and reaching every part of our daily life, more and more traffic is directed to websites in search for information. Imagine a website without any text and completely overloaded with pictures. That would be too much to bear for us.

        <p>There are advances being made in science and technology everyday, and a good example of this is the LCD monitor. LCD monitors have several benefits over the old chunky computer monitors that most users are familiar with. Old computer monitors, take up quite a bit of desktop space, put out a ton of heat, drain a ton of energy, and most often have low picture quality and resolution. Modern advances with the LCD computer monitors have changed a lot of that. The screen itself is flat, and very thin, needing very little desktop space, therefore giving you more room while working at your PC. A big advantage in my opinion is that LCD monitors donâ€™t put off all the heat that the old monitors do.</p>
